# Advent of Code 2024

Here I will post my solutions to Advent of Code 2024. As an extra challenge this year, I have decided to do try to solve it all in Scala,
which I'm learning for the first time. As the difficulty ramps up, I might switch to something I'm more comfortable with.

## Usage
The programs are designed to take the input files in the standard input:

```bash
cat input.txt | <day number>.scala
```
and they output the numerical answer for both parts of that day's challenge, separated by a newline.
